# Guide on getting the data

Since the dataset is too big to be hosted on Github, to access the data, download it from this [goolge drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nnAl7dWpk63qSvwtRLMulzvNbrYp3M4N/view?usp=sharing). Then, uncompress it and put it under the **same directory as process_project_data.R** as that reads the data (which also must be under the same directory as other Rmd files).
