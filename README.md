## JSC370 Final Project

This is part of my JSC370 Final Project, where it consists a website displaying the interactive findings, and a complete report descring my work on analyzing Github commit messages using Time Series and Natural Language Processing.

The report is contained in the Report directory. The website is online at https://williamqd.github.io/JSC370-Website/

The project is fully reproducible. The only requirement is to insert *your own* Github Access Token in process_project_data.R, which contains code that uses the access the Github API and obtain repository information. I have erased my access token for security concern. Other than that, you're free to play around with the project, **espically please checkout the website!** Instruction on how to obtain the data as well as the **short presentation** is placed on the website.
